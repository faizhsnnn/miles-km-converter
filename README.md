# 📌 Overview

The Miles to Kilometers Converter is a simple Python GUI application built using Tkinter that converts distance values from miles to kilometers with a single click.

This project was developed as part of my #90DaysOfCode journey to strengthen Python fundamentals, understand event-driven programming, and gain hands-on experience with GUI development using Tkinter.

# 🚀 Key Features


📏 Converts miles into kilometers instantly

🖥️ Clean and minimal Tkinter-based GUI

🔢 Accepts numeric user input via input field

⚡ Real-time calculation using button interaction

💡 Beginner-friendly yet professional structure

# 🛠️ Application Workflow

The application initializes a Tkinter window with input and output labels.

The user enters a distance value (in miles) into the input field.

Upon clicking the Calculate button, the application:

Reads the input value

Converts miles to kilometers using the standard formula

Displays the result dynamically in the GUI

This mirrors real-world GUI event handling and user-driven data processing.
